# T shirt Size Recommendation for Fashion based e-commerce

The Aim of the project is in the fashion e-commerce domain, understanding user size preference is just as important as understanding user style preference. A major difference between online and offline fashion shopping is that customers do not have the luxury of trying on a product. Instead, they must rely on the image of a product and the size chart to select a product that fits well. The size and fit gap leads to a substantial number of returns from online shopping. Explanatory elicitation of body measurements or shape does not scale well either. The size recommendation method we provide in this project will pre-select the consumer's size based on previous purchases and content data. We use Linear Regression Model and Clustering (K) Model on the data to learn the latent representation of all the brands with various sizes and their clothing type for users features Such as Size, Estimated Brand size, Chest(cm), Front Length(cm), Across Shoulder(cm).
